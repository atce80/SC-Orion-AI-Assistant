Orion AI Pilot Assistant: Command Console

Orion AI is a specialized, single-file web application designed to act as an in-universe command assistant for the Star Citizen universe. It leverages the power of the Gemini API and Google Search Grounding to provide real-time, context-aware responses to complex, natural language pilot commands.

Key Features

1. Context-Aware Command Execution

Submit complex commands like, "Find the nearest quantum fuel station near Area18 that is safe to land at," and Orion uses live web data (via Google Search) to provide a concise, grounded, and actionable response.

2. Voice Command Integration

Use the üéôÔ∏è Voice Command feature to speak your instructions directly to the application, streamlining operations during active flight.

3. Secure, Persistent Storage (Firebase)

Your Gemini API key is securely saved to a private area in a Firebase Firestore database (using the Canvas environment's provided setup) and is automatically loaded when you access the app again.




**All you need is a free Gemini API Key and you are good to go.**
